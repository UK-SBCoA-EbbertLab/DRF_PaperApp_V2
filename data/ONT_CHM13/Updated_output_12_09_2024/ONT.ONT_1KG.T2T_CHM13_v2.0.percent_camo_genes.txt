# This table shows what percentage of genes are camo, stratefied by genebody element
# gene_name : Ensembl gene name
# biotype : GENCODE biotype of gene
# biotype : percent of CDS bases that are camo within gene (non protein-coding genes will have value of -1)
# perc_UTR : percent of UTR bases that are camo within gene (non protein-coding genes will have value of -1)
# perc_exon : percent of exonic bases that are camo
# perc_intron : percent of intronic bases that are camo
# perc_total : percent of total gene that is camo
